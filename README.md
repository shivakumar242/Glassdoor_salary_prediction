#  Glassdoor Salary Prediction using Regression

##  Project Overview
This project aims to predict salaries of data-related roles listed on Glassdoor using multiple regression techniques. The dataset includes company ratings, job titles, experience levels, and other relevant features that influence salary.  
By performing data preprocessing, EDA, and regression modeling, the project provides insights into the most impactful factors affecting salary levels in the tech industry.

##  Objectives
- To clean and preprocess the Glassdoor dataset for analysis.  
- To identify the key features influencing salaries.  
- To build and evaluate regression models for salary prediction.  
- To visualize patterns and relationships in the data.

##  Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Google Colab  
- **Models Used:** Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso (as applicable)

##  Steps Involved

1. **Data Collection & Inspection**  
   - Imported and examined the Glassdoor dataset.  
   - Checked for null values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries.  

2. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**  
   - Removed irrelevant columns (e.g., company logos, links).  
   - Encoded categorical features like job title and location.  
   - Created new features for better prediction accuracy.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed salary trends by job title, company rating, and location.  
   - Visualized correlations and salary distributions.  
   - Identified outliers and key influencing factors.  

4. **Model Building & Evaluation**  
   - Implemented regression models using Scikit-learn.  
   - Evaluated models using metrics like MAE, MSE, and RÂ² Score.  
   - Compared performance of Linear, Ridge, and Lasso Regression.

##  Key Insights
- Company rating and job title are strong indicators of salary levels.  
- Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers have higher average salaries.  
- Cities like Bangalore and Hyderabad show higher salary ranges in the dataset.

##  Visualizations
- Salary distribution by job title.  
- Correlation heatmap for all numerical features.  
- Scatter plot between company rating and average salary.  
- Comparison of actual vs predicted salaries.
